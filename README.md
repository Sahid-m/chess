# Realtime Scalable Chess using Websocket and React JS

### Working with few task to do :
  - [ ] Add Check alert
  - [ ] Mirror the Chess UI like chess.com
  - [ ] Undo Option
  - [ ] Rematch Option
  - [ ] Match Cancel when user is not making move for more than 5 mins

## What could be Improved ( Future Plans ) 
  - [ ] Using Redis to store moves ( negligible latency issue )
  - [ ] Using A DB to Store all the matches
  - [ ] Adding A Docked Container
